        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wireless communication is the transmission of data without the use of physical connections like wires or cables. It relies on electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, to transmit signals between devices. This technology has revolutionized how people communicate, enabling mobile phones, Wi-Fi, satellite communication, and more.</p>
        
        <h2>History of Wireless Communications</h2>
        <p>The development of wireless communication began in the 19th century with the discovery of electromagnetic waves by James Clerk Maxwell and their experimental validation by Heinrich Hertz. Guglielmo Marconi is credited with inventing the first wireless telegraph in the late 1890s, which laid the foundation for modern wireless technologies.</p>
